# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud is a growing concern in the digital economy, causing billions in losses annually. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems struggle to adapt to evolving fraud tactics. Machine learning provides a smarter, adaptive approach by identifying hidden patterns and anomalies in transactions. This project aims to:
Improve fraud detection accuracy using advanced machine learning models.
Reduce false positives, minimizing inconvenience for legitimate users.
Provide real-time fraud detection capabilities for financial institutions.
It analyzes transaction patterns to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities effectively.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and data balancing.
Machine Learning Models: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for performance assessment.
Visualization: Provides insights into fraud patterns with interactive graphs.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/fraud-detection. It contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The dataset includes transaction details like amount, type, and timestamps, helping in fraud detection model training.

Technologies Used:
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
